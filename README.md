## Smart Brain
This project is the front-end to my smart-brain web application. It is written in ReactJS and allows users to register/login into their account and input a URL to an image from the web. The application will then register a box around any faces that appear in that image and re-render the page with the updated user statistics from the database. 

## Motivation
This was a project I completed while following along a Udemy course on Web Development. My motivation for this project was to learn JavaScript and gain experience using popular frameworks such as ReactJS.
